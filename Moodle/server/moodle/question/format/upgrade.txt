This files describes API changes for question import/export format plugins.

=== 2.1.5 / 2.2.3 / 2.3 ===

* The readquestions method used to take a second argument $context. However, at
  the point where this method was called, it was impossible to know what
  context the quetsions were going to be saved into, so the value could be
  wrong. Also, none of the standard question formats were using this argument,
  so it was removed. See MDL-32220.
